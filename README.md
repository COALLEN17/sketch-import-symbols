## Installing Plugins

### The conventional way:
1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/kmerc/sketch-import-symbols/archive/master.zip)
2. Copy the contents to the plugin folder (Open up Sketch, and go to `Plugins` › `Reveal Plugins Folder…` to open it.)

### The quickest way:

_NOTE: If your Mac has not installed GitHub client, You need to install [GitHub for mac](https://mac.github.com)

1. Click on the [Clone in Desktop](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/kmerc/sketch-import-symbols) button on GitHub
2. Press `command` + `shift` + `g` to find plugin folder, then paste plugin folder path

**Plugin Folder Path**

* App Store `~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins`
* Beta `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins`

## FYI
If the symbols name being imported matches the name of any symbol in the current/target document, it will be skipped.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Currently there isn't any as this probably isn't a function you'll be needing every 2 seconds.
